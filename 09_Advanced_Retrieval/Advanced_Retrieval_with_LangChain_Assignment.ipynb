Additionally, some borrowers faced limited options—such as only being offered forbearance or deferment—that resulted in ongoing interest accumulation, making it harder to repay the principal. Other reasons include financial hardships, stagnating wages, and misguidance about repayment terms and forgiveness programs, all of which contributed to their inability to fulfill repayment obligations.\\n'"
