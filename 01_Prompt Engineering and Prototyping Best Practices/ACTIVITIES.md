## Activity #1: System Capabilities & Evaluation

### 1. **Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner.**

**Aspect Tested:**
Ability to explain complex technical concepts in clear, accessible language; measuring comprehension and communication skills.

**System Performance Evaluation:**
The system delivered a friendly, accessible explanation of object-oriented programming by using retro Mac metaphors like folders and blueprints, which helped make complex ideas approachable for beginners. The playful tone and references to classic Mac features kept the response engaging and lighthearted, successfully covering the essential OOP concepts without too much jargon.

However, markdown formatting did not render correctly in the chat app, making lists and emphasis less clear and impacting readability. Improving markdown support would help organize the information visually. Additionally, while the retro Mac style from the system prompt adds personality, some references may not land with users unfamiliar with classic Mac OS. Overall, the explanation was clear and informative, but clarity and accessibility could be improved with better formatting and even simpler analogies.

### 2. **Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points…**

**Aspect Tested:**
Reading comprehension and summarization; ability to extract and condense key information.

**System Performance Evaluation:**
The system accurately identified and summarized the main points of the provided paragraph, distilling a complex research summary into clear, digestible sentences. It captured the study’s design, key findings (differences in cognitive engagement among groups, the lower ownership and recall for LLM users, and the overall conclusion about LLMs' impact on learning skills), and maintained an appropriate level of detail. The retro Mac persona kept the response playful and on-brand without distracting from the core message.

### 3. **Write a short, imaginative story (100–150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.**

**Aspect Tested:**
Creative writting; testing the model’s ability to follow length constraints and inject narrative creativity.

**System Performance Evaluation:**
The system successfully generated a creative and heartwarming short story within the specified word count. The narrative was vivid and imaginative, featuring a robot and a cybernetic cat forming an unexpected bond in a junkyard setting. The retro Mac theme was subtly integrated through details like the old Mac SE and references to vintage technology, giving the story a unique flavor while still focusing on friendship and discovery.

The tone was engaging, and the story’s structure was clear, with a beginning, middle, and end that fit the length requirement (130 words). The output balanced creativity and coherence, using expressive language and sensory details to bring the scene to life. Overall, the system performed well, but the story could be enhanced further by offering more emotional depth or dialogue, depending on the target audience’s preference.

### 4. **If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?**

**Aspect Tested:**
Basic math and problem-solving; ability to reason through step-by-step logic.

**System Performance Evaluation:**
The system clearly and accurately solved the math problem, providing both the correct calculations and final answer. The explanation was straightforward, breaking down the division steps and linking them back to the original quantities, which helps reinforce understanding. The response also maintained the retro Mac persona, adding a touch of playfulness without interfering with clarity.

However, the markdown formatting issues meant the answer wasn’t as visually distinct as it could have been—bulleted steps and bold text were present in the output, but not rendered as intended. Improving formatting support would make the step-by-step solution even easier to follow. Overall, the system demonstrated strong reasoning and clarity in presenting the math solution, with only minor improvements needed for visual organization.

### 5. **Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone…**

**Aspect Tested:**
Creative writting and tone adjustment; ability to adapt content to different formality levels.

**System Performance Evaluation:**
The system effectively transformed the informal, emotional language of the original paragraph into a polished, professional, and formal tone. It clarified disjointed ideas, removed filler phrases, and reorganized the content for logical flow while preserving the original meaning. The retro Mac persona was dialed back appropriately for this formal task, demonstrating the system’s ability to adapt tone to suit different contexts.

However, some nuances and emotional intensity from the original were softened in the process, and markdown formatting (such as clear separation or emphasis) was not visually rendered in the chat app, which slightly affected readability. Overall, the system demonstrated strong capability in rewriting for formality and professionalism, but further improvements could focus on balancing tone and emotional content while enhancing formatting for clarity.

## Discussion Question #1

**What are some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool?**

**Answer:**
Vibe checking is helpful for getting a general sense of whether your app’s responses feel appropriate, natural, or engaging—basically, whether it “feels right” to a human. However, it is inherently subjective and doesn’t reliably uncover subtle errors or edge cases. For example, it won’t catch problems like prompt injection vulnerabilities, hallucinations, or biased outputs. Vibe checking also can’t provide quantitative metrics or ensure consistency across different users or situations. To truly evaluate system robustness and safety, more rigorous methods—such as automated testing, adversarial prompt testing, and structured user studies—are needed in addition to vibe checking.
